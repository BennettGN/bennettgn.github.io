# About

Hi! I'm Bennett Godinho-Nelson, a Software Engineer and full-time student at The Ohio State University. I'm currently pursuing a B.S./M.S. in Computer Science & Engineering, with an expected graduation date of May 2026. I graduated in May 2022 with my Associate's of Science Degree alongside my highschool graduation.

At Ohio State, I work as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant, helping students with Software Development 1 and Web Development Project courses. These roles allows me to blend my passion for learning with my love for teaching.

In the past, I've had the opportunity to intern at JPMorgan Chase as a Software Engineer, where my team and I won "Best in Class" amongst 20+ intern projects across the program. I've also taken on leadership roles, including serving as the Student Representative for the CSE Undergraduate Studies Committee and leading the Software Development Club.

My interests cover a wide range of areas, including Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Systems, Full-stack Development, Cloud Computing, and Network Science. I have experience with several programming languages and technologies, such as Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and C.

Outside of my academic and my engineering pursuits, I enjoy learning about dinosaurs and modding my Nintendo 3DS. I also have a twin brother who studies Mechanical Engineering at The University of Cincinnati.

Feel free to check out my LinkedIn and Resume with the icons above or some of the posts below on projects I'm proud of! I'm very excited about the future and eager to see where my journey in Software Engineering takes me!
