For my capstone project in CSE3901, my team and I decided to create an E-Commerce website specifically designed for Ohio State Students to be able to retail their clothing and second hand goods to other OSU students. We leveraged tools including Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap for rapid CSS development, and AWS for Persistant Imaging. I was responsible for creating the homepage and analytics page to track various statistics of different clothing items. Below is a video of the final project!
