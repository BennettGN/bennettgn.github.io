As an avid Ruby programmer, I embrace any opportunity to incorporate Ruby into my projects. This website leverages a Ruby-based serverless architecture, with `Jekyll` as its core framework. `Jekyll` is a powerful Ruby gem designed for building blog-aware static sites efficiently, allowing for intuitive content management and flexibility with your website design.

To enhance the siteâ€™s professional look, I also utilize the `cvless` gem, a customizable extension built on top of Jekyll. It emphasizes professional graphic design and typography principles which has helped greatly to ensure the website is neat and polished. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which is created by the same authors as Jekyll!

Documentation to support these great gems is linked below!
